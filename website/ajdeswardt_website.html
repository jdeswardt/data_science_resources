<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I am a senior executive with extensive experience in the consumer-packaged
goods industry, retail operations, procurement, supply chain and
general management. I have a proven track record of generating increased
revenue, enhancing the bottom line and growing business units through effective
business strategies resulting in long-term sustainable growth. I’ve been able to
achieve this as General Manager and Food Buying Director for the region's
largest retailer trading in RSA and across numerous African countries. </p>

<p> I have 8 years financial experience, 12 years operational management
experience and 7 years executive food buying experience. I am able to develop
long term sustainable relationships internally and externally and collaborate
successfully with suppliers and manufacturers across various categories, and
more specifically in the food industry for the last decade. </p>

<p> Ethical behaviour is of utmost importance to me in all my dealings with
people and in business and I am known as someone that is honest, transparent
demonstrating integrity at all times. I have strong verbal abilities and can
communicate effectively with and inspire people at all levels. I have
demonstrated that I can transfer my skills and knowledge and have a track record
of building strong teams. I enjoy mentoring and coaching individuals and teams
and the success of my team / subordinates energize me. </p>

<p> My financial background has helped me in developing a strong analytical
approach to business. I understand the levers that make a business successful
and I know how to drive a business into a profitable business unit through
ensuring on shelf availability, optimum cost structures supported by hands-on
management. I strive to work in a world class environment, and I aim to create
order from chaos. I am a self starter and do not give up until the job is done
and can be counted on to deliver optimally. </p>

<p> I believe the consumer-packaged goods and supply chain industry would
benefit most from my skillset and experience where I can add significant value
across both multiple functional areas and management in the business. </p>
